# Corresponding

Move corresponding fields between structs.
Inspired by the MOVE-CORRESPONDING statement from ABAP (SAP).

Works with Options. When the source field is a Some(_) then the value will be moved.

# Expand

Run `cargo expand --test corresponding` in the corresponding folder to see the results
